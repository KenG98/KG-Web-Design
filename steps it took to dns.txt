steps it took:
1) add CNAME file to gh-pages branch of directory
2) Pull request, make gh-pages branch update the master branch
3) in DNS create CNAME record of host "web" (for web.kgarber.com) points to keng98.github.io

github uses the CNAME file, so when the web.kgarber.com points to keng98.github.io, github auto goes to the specific project repository.
